Video on how to start lab: 

On the report add the students names in your group and a Table of the tasks each member of the group performed.

To test the program since we are assuming no hazard (data or control) for testing we are going to be using a simple program:

addi x7, zero, 7

addi  x8,zero, 40 (change this address to a Data memory address in your Otter)

addi  x10,zero,10

nop

nop

or x11,x7,x10

nop

nop

sw x11,0(x8)

If you store the right value in memory, then we are done for this lab (show this on the waveform and highlight where this result is stored)

On the report :

1. add the students' names in your group and a Table of the tasks each group member performed.

2. contributions of every team member

3. All project files

3. Describe the design decisions the team took

4. Prove that it compiles, synthesize to the board by running the above code; you can make a video of your project compiling, simulating /creating correct waveform and on the Basys board
