Objective:
This lab aims to implement a matrix-matrix multiplication algorithm in assembly language for the RISC-V architecture. This exercise will help you understand the concepts of matrix multiplication and assembly language programming for RISC-V.

Requirements:
Basic understanding of RISC-V assembly language.
Familiarity with matrix multiplication algorithms.
RISC-V assembly development environment
Background:
Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in linear algebra and finds applications in various fields, such as computer graphics, scientific computing, and machine learning. The algorithm for matrix-matrix multiplication involves multiplying each element of a row from the first matrix with each element of a column from the second matrix and summing up the results to obtain the corresponding component of the resulting matrix.

Consider two matrices A and B:

A = | a11 a12 a13 |      B = | b11 b12 b13 |
    | a21 a22 a23 |          | b21 b22 b23 |
    | a31 a32 a33 |          | b31 b32 b33 |
The resulting matrix C, obtained by multiplying A and B, will be:

C = | (a11*b11 + a12*b21 + a13*b31)  (a11*b12 + a12*b22 + a13*b32)  (a11*b13 + a12*b23 + a13*b33) |
    | (a21*b11 + a22*b21 + a23*b31)  (a21*b12 + a22*b22 + a23*b32)  (a21*b13 + a22*b23 + a23*b33) |
    | (a31*b11 + a32*b21 + a33*b31)  (a31*b12 + a32*b22 + a33*b32)  (a31*b13 + a32*b23 + a33*b33) |

This code in C maybe useful to understand the implementation:

Procedure:
Initialize Matrices: Define A, B, and C with appropriate dimensions and initial values.
Create a function to perform Matrix-Matrix Multiplication Algorithm using the stack correctly and the RISC-V calling convention as explained in class
Call the function you just created with the initialized Matrices; you can find initialization for 3x3,...,50x50 arrays in datasets.zipDownload datasets.zip
Check that the implementation is correct by comparing your results with the values generated by a matrix multiplication calculator like  https://matrix.reshish.com/multiplication.phpLinks to an external site.
